A stupid script to scrape data from Facebook's Birthdays ICAL. Probably against terms of use. Who cares. Astrology!

## Context
Facebook used to have a API, but they scrapped it. So we need to go and do some old-school scraping, [zuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPazh2kDdvA) style.

## Usage Instructions - Scraper Script
Go to the bottom right of the Facebook [Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPazh2kDdvA) Page. You should see a Birthdays option on the lower right, above the language selector.
- Clone this repo
- Download the ICAL, renaming it to *my.ics*
- Navigate to the directory in Gitbash or Terminal or whatever.
- Run **Python ./script** for the named version or **Python ./anon_script** for the slightly more GDPR compliant version.
- Try and follow through what the script is doing.
- Check results *output.csv* or *output2.csv*

## Usage Introduction - Calendar to Zodiac
- Run **Python ./days_signs**
- Try to figure out what the script is doing
- Inspect results in *signs.csv*
